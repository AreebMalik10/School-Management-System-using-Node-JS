I developed a School Management System as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to streamline school administration and communication between admins, teachers, students, and parents. The system consists of different panels for Super Admin, Admin, Students, Teachers, and Parents, each with tailored functionalities to manage various tasks efficiently.

Super Admin Panel:

The Super Admin can create, edit, and delete admin accounts, ensuring centralized management and control over the platform's user base.
Admin Panel:

Admins can manage user accounts for students, teachers, and parents, including generating unique usernames and secure passwords automatically.
Admins handle records for all users, manage fee structures, process leave requests for teachers, and create announcements.
Admins can also manage student fines, including generating fine slips.


Student Panel:

Students can log in to view their attendance records, grades, fee payment status, and download fee challans.
They can submit leave requests and view announcements made by the admin.
Students can also view and download their assigned fines through their panel.


Teacher Panel:

Teachers can log in to mark attendance, assign grades, and manage class details.
They can submit leave requests, respond to student leave requests, and view announcements.


Parent Panel:

Parents can log in to monitor their child’s attendance, grades, and fee payment status.
They can view announcements and track their child’s fines, with the option to download fine slips.
